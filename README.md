# education3.0

Fun RAG app to pull problems from math textbooks and generate lesson plans from them + solve them & grade student responses!

# Installation Steps:

1. For now, you will need to clone the repo on your computer:

`$ cd /path/to/desired/install/directory`

`$ git clone https://github.com/ng4567/education3.0.git`

2. Then, create a groq API key here: [link](https://console.groq.com/keys)

Then, set the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable or create a `.env` file and load it using the `python-dotenv` library (you will need to modify my code if you don't take this option to avoid import errors).
